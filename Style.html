<h1><U>Against the rule</U></h1>
<p CLASS="ONE"><i>Poem of the week
Congratulations 🎉
𝗔𝗚𝗔𝗜𝗡𝗦𝗧 𝗠𝗬 𝗥𝗨𝗟𝗘
You went against my rule of chastity
Having a big stature isn't maturity
The worth were only kept with virginity
It really isn't a joke, sexual purity
I kept and guard it, so jealously
But you invaded and trespassed, secretly
You said it's just once, nonchalantly
I was in serious pain, so deadly
Against my rule you went, nonetheless
With everything, and all, she felt lessened
You left her in pain and sadness
She never recovered, from the grief and weariness
Her body was a temple, so precious
With her life, was she zealous
The honour and respect she carried, you oust
She was so sad, it was all extemporaneous
Halleluyah Bayode (favoured pen)

<h2>Heart for sale </h2>
<p CLASS="ONE"><i>Heart ♥ for Sale
      A want ad I put in the paper today:
" BROKEN HEARTS WANTED TOP DOLLAR WILL PAY "
      My plan was to salvage the unbroken parts, then make me one strong and unbreakable ♥ heart.
      To brave all the heartaches and pain it would take, a heart that was able to bend but not break.
      Some hearts were hopeless, beyond all repair, crushed were their spirits, their souls in despair.
       I removed all the sadness and pain I could find, this heart must be flawless and one of a kind.
       I put all the kindness and love I could spare, I held nothing back, for to skimp I not dare.
       As one final touch, just before I was through, I added some sunshine, a rainbow 🌈 or two.
       Through trial and error and blood, sweat and tears and long, lonely nights, after struggling for years.
        I finally completed this fine work of art, a rugged but caring unbreakable ♥ heart.
        I took out an ad in the paper today, these are the words that the notice would say :
        " Make me an offer, am willing to sell :  A HEART MADE IN HEAVEN, AFTER GOING THROUGH HELL"</i></p>
